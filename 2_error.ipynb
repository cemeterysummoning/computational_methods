    "# Error Quantification\n",
    "## True error\n",
    "True error is simply the difference between the true value and the approximated value found by a program, denoted as $E_t$. By its very nature, every approximation is going to be different from the true value; approximations are meant to produce a value \"good enough\" for calculation while preserving some computing power. For example, the derivative at a point can be approximated as \n",
    "$$f'(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$\n",
    "In discrete systems, like computers, symbolic differentiation is a challenging task; while we can simply differentiate and plug in values for the derivative of $7e^{0.5x}$, it is much easier to forgo mathematical accuracy in favor of a \"good enough\" approximation. The true error, then, would be the difference \n",
    "$$f'(x) - \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$ \n",
    "However, the magnitude of some true error is not sufficient to communicate the full picture of the nature of the error itself; an error of 1 is excellent for some large mumber, but is horrible for a really small number.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative error\n",
    "Relative error aims to remedy the issue with true error by dividing the true error by the true value; in doing so, it aims to quantify the amount of error present in terms of the actual value. Relative error is equal to \n",
    "$$\\epsilon_t = \\frac{\\text{True value - Approximate value}}{\\text{True value}} = \\frac{E_t}{f(x_0)}$$\n",
    "However, there is a small problem; relative error, along with true error, requires us to have knowledge of the true value, which is not always the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approximate error\n",
    "Approximate error is the difference between some present approximation and a previously executed approximation, with the motivation being that comparisons between some iterated process of generating approximations will be able to quantify error relative to each other.\n",
    "$$E_a = \\text{Present approximation - Previous approximation}$$\n",
    "However, this suffers from the same issue as true error, in that it is just a magnitude; there is no way to gauge how serious the error is in relation to the actual value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative approximate error\n",
    "Relative approximation is a similar approach to error as relative error, different in that it uses approximate error instead of true error. \n",
    "$$\\epsilon_a = \\frac{\\text{Present approximation - Previous approximation}}{\\text{Present approximation}} = \\frac{\\text{new - old}}{\\text{new}}$$"
